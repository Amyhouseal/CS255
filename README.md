Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  DriverPass was looking to create a web based system that will assist their clients with passing their driving exams. They wnanted to build a system that will include online content such as courses
  and exams. The ability to purchase packages and schedule in person driving instuction was also necessary 
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I did well with articulating the details throughout the business requirements document. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would improve on my system designs. I would like to add more detail to them and how the entire system will interact with one another. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  When interpretting the user's needs I did so by priority. I tried to get a good understanding of what was critical for the system to include and then add the additional aspects after the structure of the system was complete. It is important to consider the users needs when designing because this will decrease the number of necessary revisions in the future. It is also the documentation that the developers will use to understand what is necessary in the system, so it is important to make it accurate. 
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  When approaching designing software I believe it is important to do it the same as when developing. Taking larger tasks and making them smaller.
